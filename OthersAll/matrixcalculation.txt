write a c pogram two matrix A[10][10],B[10][10].
To find the subtraction,multiplication,addition of these matrix. and
To find the Transpose any Matrix, you need to Interchange Rows with Columns of Matrix 
and Columns with Rows of the Matrix.
The Main Diagonal Elements are the ones that occur from Top Left of Matrix Down To Bottom Right Corner.

Input: matrix A[10][10],B[10][10],row & colum are an integer m,n 0<m<10,0<n<10,one string which is define  subtraction,multiplication,addition,Transpose
     of this matrix. End of the input print End.
Output: each element different by one space. if these matrix are order  c print Matrix with entered orders can't be multiplied/subtracted/addaed with each other.
	others print Multipication, Subtraction, sumesion of A&B and Transpose of Matrix.
Input:
	Enter matrix A:
	Row & colum: 3 3 
	1 2 3
        4 5 6
        7 8 9
	Enter matrix B:
	Row & colum: 3 3 
	1 2 3
        4 5 6
        7 8 9
	multiplication
	End

Output: Multipication of A&B:
	30 36 42
	66 81 96
	102 126 150
